# Saltpad documentation

SaltPad is a GUI tool to manage SaltStack deployments + orchestration. It's still very young and it should be considered as Alpha.

__This version of saltpad is a full-rewrite as a single app page. The old version in python is still available in the saltpad_v1 branch (https://github.com/tinyclues/saltpad/tree/saltpad_v1). If you cannot use this version, please open an issue to ease migration and see the [Changelog](../Changelog.md).__
